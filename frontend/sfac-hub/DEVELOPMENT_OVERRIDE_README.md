# Development Override Configuration - RESTORED TO PRODUCTION

## ✅ RESTORATION COMPLETE ✅

**All development overrides have been successfully removed and the system has been restored to its standard production configuration.**

## What Was Removed

The following development-specific overrides have been completely removed:

1. **`src/config/devConfig.ts`** - Development configuration file (DELETED)
2. **`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`** - Removed development overrides and warning banner
3. **`src/pages/StockAvailability.tsx`** - Removed development overrides and warning banner
4. **`src/pages/MakeReservation.tsx`** - Already clean (no overrides were present)
5. **`src/pages/LostAndFound.tsx`** - Already clean (no overrides were present)

## Current Production Configuration

The system now operates with standard production authentication:

- **Authentication Required**: All protected routes now require proper authentication
- **Token Validation**: Components check for valid access/refresh tokens
- **Login Redirect**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page
- **No Bypass**: No development bypasses or overrides are active
- **Clean Code**: All development-specific code has been removed

## Protected Routes

The following routes now require proper authentication:
- `/dashboard`
- `/stock-availability`
- `/make-reservation`
- `/lost-and-found`

## Security Status

- ✅ All development overrides removed
- ✅ Production authentication active
- ✅ No authentication bypasses
- ✅ Proper token validation in place
- ✅ Clean codebase with no development artifacts

## Verification

To verify the restoration is complete:

1. **No Development Files**: `src/config/devConfig.ts` has been deleted
2. **No Override Imports**: No components import development configuration
3. **No Warning Banners**: No development warning banners are displayed
4. **Proper Authentication**: All protected routes require login
5. **Clean Console**: No development warnings in browser console

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for production deployment with:
- Standard authentication flow
- Proper security measures
- Clean, maintainable code
- No development artifacts
